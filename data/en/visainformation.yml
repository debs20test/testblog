title1: Visas for Entering Canada and Quebec
visaInformationText: One of the first things a visitor to Quebec City should note is that Canada's entry requirements have changed slightly since March 2016. Citizens of visa-exempt countries such as the European Union states, Australia, and others are now required to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA) if they're arriving to Quebec City by air. For more information visit <a href="https://official-canada-eta.com/canada-eta-resources/visa-for-quebec-city-quebec/">Visa for Quebec City, Quebec, Canada</a>
VisaExemptText: A full list of <a href="https://official-canada-eta.com/canada-eta-requirements/">visa-exempt countries can be found here</a>. Nationals of other countries will require a full visa to enter Canada by any method and for any purpose.
